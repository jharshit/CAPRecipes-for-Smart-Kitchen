## Abstract

In the past few years, the general work habits of people have changed dramatically, raising concerns about their well-being. Numerous health related problems have been observed from their health records such as obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, etc. The population, in general, is realizing that healthy living is important for their well-being. Healthy eating is identi ed as one of the main concerns as reported. It is mainly due to lack of awareness about what is healthy to eat, while considering their taste. To resolve these prob-lems, healthy dietary patterns along with their dynamically changing taste preferences are truly essential to maintain a salubrious life, which is quite challenging. Numerous re-searchers have been working in this eld and developed vari-ous applications and systems to suggest healthy dietary pat-terns. In addition, because of the increase in human needs and their desire to organize ingredients in their refrigera-tor, prompted the development of smart refrigerators which uses these applications at their back-end. However, the re-searchers in general, did not focus on numerous potential factors such as user's rating and likes/dislikes on social me-dia, that would have high impact on dynamically changing user preferences.

Thus, we propose the implementation of context-aware personalized recipe recommender as a proof-of-concept to utilize general and personal contextual data in order to sug-gest better personalized recipe recommendations. The gen-eral contextual data includes attributes of the ingredients/ cooked meals (i.e., availability, expiry and quantity) that are currently available in the refrigerator and the current meal time. The dynamic personal contextual data includes the browsing history, user's own recipe rating as well recipe rating of other users, likes/dislikes on social media, health related information (i.e., allergies, diseases, calories intake), faith/belief restrictions (i.e., vegan, veg, sabbath) and cui-sine style. The proposed system uses two types of recom-mender sub systems: 1) Collaborative recommender that adds recipes from other users, who have similar context into the user's own personal context based on computed rating on recipes; 2) Content-Based recommender that lters per-sonalized recipes, using the general and personal contextual data together. After getting recommendation list, users can also rate, read, watch and share the recipes. Once the user selects the recipe to prepare, the application will automat-ically reduces the quantity of the ingredients as per the in-structions provided.
